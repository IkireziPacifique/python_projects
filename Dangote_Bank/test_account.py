# Testing process for account file and the algorithm

# __init__ method
'''
    I added the attributes and gave them a default value
so that it won't be required in the main file.
    Then gave created a self variable for each so that it
can be easily used throughout the program.
'''

# deposit method
'''
    Ask the user who is going to deposit, checks if they have an account,
if they do they ask them how much they are depositing then adds it to the 
current balance.
'''

# withdraw method
'''
    Ask the user who is going to withdraw, checks if they have an account,
if they do, ask them how much they are withdraw then removes it to the 
current balance.

# view method
'''
    For the view function I put the 'for loop' so that it can bring all cars 
and I added the variable fo increment the number of a car.
'''

# transfer method
'''
    Ask the user who is going to transfer, checks if they have an account,
ask the user receiver, checks if they have an account if they do, they ask 
them how much they are transfer then removes it the adds to the receiver account.

     To check this I added a printout to under the input to check if they are working correctly
