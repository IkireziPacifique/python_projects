# Testing process for moto file and the algorithm

# carbon_footprint method
'''
    In this method we first ask the user to input the plate number of the car they
want to check carbon footprint for then checks if it is in the dictionary(using the
if condition).
    It then ask the user for input, when I was testing I added a print to check if
it is working properly.
