# Testing process for vehicle file and the algorithm

# __init__ method
'''
    I added the attributes and gave them a default value
so that it won't be required in the main file.
    Then gave created a self variable for each so that it
can be easily used throughout the program.
'''

# add_vehicle method
'''
    Added an input to every variable so that they user can put
in their data , then add them to the dictionary.
    I tested it by adding a printout under the input so I see if 
it is running smoothly.(I deleted the printout codes)
'''

# delete_vehicle method
''''
    The delete function ask the user input the plate number they want to delete
then checks if it is in the dictionary,if it finds it removes it from the dictionary.
'''

# rent_vehicle method
''''
    Rent function ask the user input the plate number they want to to rent,
then checks if it is in the dictionary,if it finds it adds one to the number 
it was rented, ask the user the number of times they rented it and adds it to 
the existing balance.

    To test this I put a print out under each variable to see it is operating correctly
'''

# view_vehicle method
''''
    For the view function I put the 'for loop' so that it can bring all cars and I added
the variable fo increment the number of a car.

'''

# no_operation method
'''
    The user inputs N when they want to stop and Y to continue
